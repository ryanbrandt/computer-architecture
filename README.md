Some of my projects from my computer architecture course. All written with C for linux machines.

Just six smaller projects implementing and applying data structures, sorting, and more in C.

### PA2 ###
Three smaller projects focusing on bit manipulation/masking, such as getting, setting and other logical operations

### PA3 ###
Binary bomb lab, a project in where you have to step through assembly code with a debugger to reverse engineer several "phases".
